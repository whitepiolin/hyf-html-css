                <h2>My HackYourFuture Life</h2>
                <p>After coming as a refugee to the Netherlands, I started searching in order to build a new carrier. <br> 
                        All refugees have to face with starting a second life. Fortunately, I see that situation as an opportunity.<br>
                        <br> To advance my next career, I have chosen IT sector. I believe that, one of the most prominent professions of time is Information Technologies. I love the way of life based on technology and especially computers. <br>
                        In my opinion, one of the ways to persue a happy life is to do a profession that you love.<br>
                        I believe in that I would satisfy myself by IT studies and works. Thus, I have chosen to shape my life in this route. My basic aim is to become a well-educated coder.<br> <br>
                        So, I have attended to <span class="spectext">Hack Your Future</span> team.<br>

                <h2>Learning Strategies</h2>
                <p>To change something in your life, you need to change what’s going on in your inner mind. This is our subconscious mind. <br>
                        Whether you want success, peak performance, or more respect in your career… whether you learn something new… <br> 
                        You must make changes, shifts, and enhancements to your inner life. <br>
                        Learning Strategies have helped millions. These programs give us strategies, inspiration, and guidance for our nonconscious mind. so we experience noticeable results in our everyday learning.
                </p>
                <p>There are many different ways about learning strategies. <br>
                    <a href="https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/learning-strategies/">For instance, you can click here for a good one.</a>

                <img src="images/Learning.png" alt="6 different learning strategies" class="groupphoto">
                <h3>My Favourite One</h3>
                <p>Yes, my favourite learning strategy is "SPACED PRACTICE". What is it actually?<br>
                       Teachers often wait until the day before a test to review. When enough students score well on the test, it appears they have learned the material. But a few weeks later, most of that information has vanished from students’ minds. For more durable learning, the studying has to take place in smaller chunks over time.
                       <br> Weinstein explains it like that : “Every time you leave a little space, you forget a bit of the information, and then you kind of relearn it. That forgetting actually helps you to strengthen the memory. It’s kind of counterintuitive, but you need to forget a little bit in order to then help yourself learn it by remembering again.”<br>
                       In other words, repeat after learning again and again and again....
